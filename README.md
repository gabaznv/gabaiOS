# gabaiOS

hi and welcome to gabaiOS
in here you can experience a CLI version of gabaiOS.
This was made in python, so it is not a real os, so it's considered a prototype.

# REQUIREMENTS

- Python (preferably python 3)
- 1mb internal storage

# HOW TO RUN

On macOS, Linux and Windows you can simply open a terminal and type "python main.py" or "python3 main.py". From there you will create a new user and log in with the account.

# FORGOT PASSWORD

if you somehow forgot your password you can delete credentials.txt and restart the program. Also if you're in the OS Interface you can type fuser which will automatically delete credentials.txt

# BUGS

if you find bugs/errors you can contact me on gabaihype@gmail.com with the bug/error and a screenshot
